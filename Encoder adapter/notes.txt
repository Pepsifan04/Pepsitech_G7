Designed to connect 5mm with 3mm rod and attaching encoder shroud.
CHANNELS A AND B ON THE ENCODER NEED TO BE SWAPPED!


=========================================
IMPORTANT!!

If you're running non-stock gear ratio (like for ex 22:1) you need to design your own encoder
for 27:1 I'm using 36 slot, if ratio the bigger the ratio the less slots in the encoder.

Same applies if you want to change max rotatio of the wheel, the more rotation the smaller encoder.

Stock wheel has 982 pulses for full 900 degrees (around, stock is not exact 16:1, but assume this value is accurate and adjust from here)
