Originally designed to reduce the CLACK of the G27. This project transformed itself into a customizable platform, that supports stock G27/29 board as well as custom STM (or other boards).


All of the 3d printed parts are printed in PLA, with efficiency and strength in mind. Steering column support, simply named front and back plate are designed to allow various gear ratios, user designed attachements, and make alignment of back-front rods easier.
Belts used are HTD3M 8mm 330mm, they don't slip or stretch.

Pulleys are a two-part parts, this allows for change of gear ratios or other works without need for complete dissasembly.

Rotation limiting is done by using a lead screw with a "stopper" as one of the "transfer" rods, when rotating it moves the "stopper" back or forth untill it hits a stop after specified distance, thus limiting the wheel rotation and stopping the wheel. It is entirely possible to make the wheel turn 1080 deg or 360 deg, using different distances for stoppers and different lead screw ratios.
PC software will obv still think that it is 900 deg, but in most sims you can/ or have to set maximum wheel rotation, and it's the sim calculating when you should hit a soft stop after reaching max steering angle with the car.

Deadzone is still there, that's how brushed DC motors work, unfortunately. However by using smaller rated voltage motors there is possibility of reducing it, if not removing completely.
